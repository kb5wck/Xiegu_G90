How to write the contents of a Memory Channel (MC) back to the VFO so you can tune or adjust the frequency and other parameters.

1. Press the VM key below the display and choose a stored frequency.
2. Short press the FUNC key, the F LED will illuminate.
3. Short press the A/B key (writes contents of MC to VFO - unfortunately both VFOs)
4. Short press the FUNC key to it off, the F LED will turn off.
5. Short press the VM key (back to VFO mode) - now with MC contents displayed and tunable.
